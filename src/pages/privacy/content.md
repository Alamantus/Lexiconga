## Privacy Policy

This document was last updated on June 5, 2019 to update information about our hosting service and how your data is used (i.e. to display your dicitonaries and sometimes send you emails if you agree to receive them) and to reflect changes to Lexiconga made during the app update.

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Lexiconga collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the https://lexiconga.com website ("Site") and its accounts ("Account").

### Personal identification information
We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, their name and email address. Users may, however, use our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personal identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related activities.

### Non-personal identification information
We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site through website analytics tools. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about Users means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information.

### Web browser cookies
Our Site stores manually-specified "cookies": one that is used to keep Users logged in to their Accounts and others that track what announcements have been dismissed. Our site does use and require "local storage" to function: the User's web browser places local storage on their hard drive, and our Site uses it for the sole purpose of storing your current dictionary. User may choose to set their web browser to refuse local storage usage, but if they do so, the Site will not function properly.

### How we use collected information
Lexiconga may collect and use Users personal information for the following purposes:  

- **To run and operate our Site and personalize User experience:** We need your input to display content on the Site correctly, because it is a tool built entirely to display the content that you enter.

We do not use your data in _any way_ other than to serve your content or to send the occasional update emailâ€”you may opt out of receiving emails at any time via your Account Settings! Your email address is tied directly to your account, however, so altering it _will change your login credentials_.

### How we protect your information
If you are utilizing an Account, we protect your information by keeping your information on a trusted database server provided by the Site's web host, [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/). All data you save from an Account is uploaded to this database server from your browser. If we ever change web hosts, you will be notified via the on-site notification.

If you utilize the ability to make dictionaries associated with an Account visible to the public, you accept all responsibility for its content being visible to anyone who might find it. We cannot protect what you willingly put in public, and we do not accept liability if information you place online is used against you somehow. Never put personal information online!

If you are not using an Account, then all of your information remains right on your own computer where it belongs. As mentioned previously, all data is stored in your browser's "local storage".

### Sharing your personal information
We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.

### Electronic newsletters
If User decides to opt-in to our mailing list, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. We may use third party service providers like MailChimp to help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending out newsletters or surveys. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes provided that you have given us your permission.

### Third party websites
Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licencors and other third parties. While we manually curate what links we allow in our advertisements, we do not control the content that appears on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website's own terms and policies.

### Advertising
No advertisements exist in the Lexiconga source code. Any advertisements you might see when viewing a Lexiconga dictionary will only have been added by a user for their own reasons.

### Changes to this privacy policy
Lexiconga has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of our Site. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this privacy policy periodically and become aware of modifications.

### Your acceptance of these terms

Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.
